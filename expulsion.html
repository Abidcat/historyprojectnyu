  <h1>The Edict of Expulsion (1492)</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Edict of Expulsion</strong>, issued by Ferdinand and Isabella on March 31, 1492, marked the forced removal of Jews from Spain. The monarchs decreed that all Jews must convert to Christianity or leave the kingdom. The edict stated: <q>...we order all Jews and Jewesses of whatever age they may be, who live, reside, and exist in our said kingdoms and lordships... that by the end of the month of July next of the present year, they depart from all of these our said realms and lordships...</q>, giving the Jewish population only a few months to comply.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The Jews increase in continuing their evil and wicked purpose wherever they live and congregate... instructing them in the ceremonies and observances of their law..." (*Edict of Expulsion, 1492*).
  </blockquote>

  <p>This decree reflects the prevailing notion that the presence of Jews was corrupting Christian society. The monarchy justified their expulsion by accusing Jews of causing newly converted Christians to relapse into Judaism, thereby threatening the unity of Christian Spain. Many Jews, unable to convert, were forced into exile, seeking refuge in places like North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.</p>

  <h2>The Language of the Edict</h2>
  <p>The language of the edict reveals the deep-seated antisemitism of the time. It portrays Jews as a threat to Christian society, stating:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "...great injury has resulted and still results, since the Christians have engaged in and continue to engage in social interaction and communication they have had means and ways they can to subvert and to steal faithful Christians from our holy Catholic faith and to separate them from it, and to draw them to themselves and subvert them to their own wicked belief and conviction..."
  </blockquote>

  <p>This quote demonstrates how Jews were blamed for supposedly corrupting Christians, particularly conversos (converted Jews). The use of phrases like "subvert" and "wicked belief" portrays Jews as inherently dangerous to both the Catholic faith and the social order. The monarchy viewed Jewish influence as a direct threat to the unity of Spain, which was seeking to consolidate religious and political power under Catholicism.

    Moreover, the edict reflects broader societal fears regarding conversos. Even after converting, many Jews were suspected of secretly practicing Judaism, leading to ongoing persecution by the Inquisition. This suspicion was rooted in anxieties about religious loyalty and the belief that conversos were never truly part of the Christian community. In this context, Jews became a convenient scapegoat for any signs of religious instability.

    The passage also highlights the fear of social interaction between Jews and Christians, suggesting that Jews were using relationships to "steal faithful Christians." This idea that the presence of Jews could destabilize Christian society laid the groundwork for their expulsion. By framing Jews as a religious and political threat, the Spanish monarchy justified the drastic measure of expelling them from the kingdom, using antisemitism as a tool for enforcing religious uniformity.</p>

  <h2>Consequences of the Edict</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An estimated <strong>50,000 to 200,000 Jews</strong> were forced to leave Spain.</li>
    <li>Those who remained had to convert to Christianity, often under duress.</li>
    <li>The expulsion led to a significant loss of intellectual and economic capital for Spain.</li>
    <li>It marked a turning point in Jewish history, dispersing Sephardic Jews across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <strong>Edict of Expulsion</strong> stands out as one of the unfortunate examples of religious intolerance to come out of early modern Europe. It shows just how deeply intertwined political and religious motives were in the justification of persecution and the banishment of minorities. This represents a gigantic insight into the mindset of the Spanish monarchy at that time and, further, the social pressures that led to such a drastic measure. It is a grim reminder of the human cost of religious persecution.</p>
