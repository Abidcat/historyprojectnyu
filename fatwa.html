  <h1>The Oran Fatwa (1504)</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Oran Fatwa</strong>, issued in 1504, was a critical religious document for the <strong>Muslims of Spain</strong>, particularly for the <strong>Moriscos</strong> who were forcibly converted to Christianity. This fatwa provided detailed guidelines for how Muslims could outwardly conform to Christian practices while secretly preserving their Islamic faith. For example, the fatwa advised:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "If they oblige you to drink wine, you may do so, but let it not be your intention to make use of it."
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "If, at the hour of prayer, they force you to prostrate yourself before their idols... bow down to whatever idols they are bowing to, but turn your intention toward Allah."
  </blockquote>

  <p>The fatwa provided Moriscos with a means of survival under increasingly hostile Christian rule. It allowed them to outwardly conform to practices like drinking wine or participating in Christian ceremonies, as long as their internal intention remained focused on Islam. This guidance helped Muslims maintain their religious identity in secret, thus allowing their faith to survive despite the forced conversions.</p>

  <h2>The Emotional and Social Cost</h2>
  <p> For them, the double life that the Oran Fatwa prescribed for them tolled heavily on the Moriscos. In a state of perpetual fear of being prosecuted by the Inquisitors to burden one's life continuously by apprehension and tension, many Moriscos had to be careful of every word he spoke in public, of every gesture he made.</p>
  <p> Parents had to teach their children how to appear a Christian to others but would personally instruct the child about Islam. Because of this, a generation grew up in an identity crisis: things that used to be communal-family time was spent celebrating or participating in a religious practice-now were hidden and not shared, weakening relations within a family based on shared community and mutual support.</p>
  <p> Even as the fatwa's guidance provided a way of survival, it brought with itself a number of moral and psychological dilemmas. Most Moriscos never reconciled themselves with their openly professed unbelief despite religious approval. Participation in most of the Christian rituals, even with the internal intention of rejecting them, can cause deep internal conflict for many.</p>
  <p>While we can't know the exact emotional toll this took on individuals, the fatwa's content suggests a life of constant vigilance, secrecy, and compromise of outward religious expression. The need for such a document itself speaks to the difficult circumstances Moriscos faced, forced to balance their faith with their safety in a hostile environment.</p>

  <h2>Specific Guidance from the Fatwa</h2>
  <p>The fatwa provided detailed instructions on how to navigate various scenarios, including forced declarations of faith and consumption of forbidden foods:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "If they say, 'Jesus is the son of God,' say that if they force you to, but let it be your intention to say it without the words in the possessive case, namely, that servant of Allah, the son of Mary, who is rightly revered."
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "If they force pork on you, eat it, but in your heart reject it, and hold firm to the belief that it is forbidden."
  </blockquote>

  <p>These instructions demonstrate the lengths to which Muslims were expected to go to preserve their faith while avoiding persecution. The fatwa even advised on how to handle forced marriages to Christians and the taking of usury, always emphasizing the importance of internal rejection of these practices while outwardly complying.</p>

  <p>The fatwa also addressed the issue of prayer, stating:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "If you are prevented from praying, then you should make up at nighttime what you have had to omit during the day."
  </blockquote>

  <p>This shows how Muslims were encouraged to maintain their religious practices in secret, even when unable to do so openly.</p>

  <h2>Muslim Prayer Practices</h2>
  <p>Central to Islamic faith is the practice of <strong>Salat</strong>, the ritual prayer performed <strong>five times a day</strong>. These prayers are performed at specific times:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fajr</strong>: Just before dawn.</li>
    <li><strong>Dhuhr</strong>: Around midday, after the sun passes its highest point.</li>
    <li><strong>Asr</strong>: In the afternoon, between midday and sunset.</li>
    <li><strong>Maghrib</strong>: Just after sunset.</li>
    <li><strong>Isha</strong>: At night, before midnight.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each prayer involves a series of physical movements—standing, bowing, and prostrating—along with the recitation of specific verses from the Quran. The fatwa's guidance on making up missed prayers at night highlights the importance of <strong>Salat</strong> and the emphasis on maintaining one's spiritual connection with Allah, even under dire circumstances. The fatwa provided the Moriscos with the flexibility needed to maintain their religious obligations in secret, ensuring the continuity of their faith.</p>
