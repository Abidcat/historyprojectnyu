        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this historical exploration of the complex relationships between Jews and Muslims under Christian Rule in early modern Europe. This project focuses on two pivotal documents that shaped the experiences of religious minorities in Europe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Edict of Expulsion (1492), which forced Jews to either convert to Christianity or leave Spain</li>
            <li>The Oran Fatwa (1504), which provided guidance to Muslims on how to maintain their faith under Christian rule</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through these documents, we'll examine the challenges faced by religious minorities and the strategies they developed for survival in an increasingly intolerant society.</p>
